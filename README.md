This project is intentionally simple because I believe:

Building small projects independently is better than watching tutorials endlessly without implementation.

Instead of jumping to complex systems, I focused on understanding the fundamentals of:

Express server setup

Middleware flow

Body parsing

Route handling

Form submission logic

Strong foundations > flashy complexity.

🚀 Project Overview

This is a basic password-protected webpage built using Node.js and Express.

A user enters a password in a form.

If the password matches, a secret page is revealed.

If not, the user is redirected back.
